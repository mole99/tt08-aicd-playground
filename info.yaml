  discord:      "mole99"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "A mixed-signal test project for the analog IC design course at Graz University of Technology."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Analog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     1000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "2x2"          # Valid values for analog projects: 1x2, 2x2

  # How many analog pins does your project use?
  analog_pins: 2        # Valid values: 0 to 6
  uses_3v3: true       # Set to true if your project uses 3.3V (VAPWR) in addition to 1.8V (VDPWR)
